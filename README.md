## Computer vision utilities
This repository is for publishing small functions and utilities that help me write more complex components for various projects. Unfortunately, I find myself needing to write such functions almost every day, but now I plan to solve this by organizing them all in one place.

### lsimgs
This simple utility prints the properties of images in a specified folder.

Example Usage:

`python3 lsimgs.py ~/images`

or, to filter by a specific format (e.g., TIFF):

`python3 lsimgs.py ~/images -t tiff`
